# R-Classifier-with-NN

Implementation of a classifier with a neural network written in R

This repository provdes the code, data, and notes accompanying my first practical application written in R.  My intent is to provide a general overview of how things work while showing a bit of my workflow.

* [DataExplortation.md](DataExploration.md): Code I wrote for minor data exploration and visualization.
* [NeuralNet.md](NeuralNet.md): Code I wrote for implementing the classifier and neural network.
